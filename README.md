Agile Product Ownership
Maximizing the role and accelerating success

Maximizing the Role and Accelerating Success
Many teams want to see better agile results, but can’tpinpoint the root cause of their struggles. In many cases, the
missing link between agile struggle and agile success is a lack of focus on the Product Owner role. Most Product
Owners are just thrown into the role. They don’t understand what product ownership is and don’t receive Product
Owner training. When teams only focus on Scrum Master training and sprint execution, teams can easily create
waste and rework, building the WRONG stuff, maybe even faster!



The Product Owner role is critical to ensure the team deliversvalueby working on the RIGHT product, features,
and feature details. This is so important to project success, it inspired this eBook. Enjoy a journey into what great

Are you seeing any of these symptoms?


Never-Ending or Carry-Over Stories- Do your iterations/sprints drag on for weeks or months after the
target delivery date? Does your team complete iterations on time, but only after deciding to carry several
stories over to the next iteration? Does your team struggle with low morale because they don’t feel like
they are making progress?
Going Nowhere Quickly- Does your team focus on speed/velocity instead of focusing on value and
building the right thing?
Foggy Future- Does your team have a clear vision? Do they have a shared understanding of the product?
Do they know how each iteration contributes to the vision? Do they understand how every item in the
backlog connects to the vision?
Skeptical Leaders- Are leaders questioning if agile is delivering promised benefits? Do they still see
scope creep? Are defect lists and enhancement requests trending up? Has product quality/value from a
business and user perspective remained the same or decreased?
In contrast, effective product ownership delivers pleasant side effects like:
- Sprints/iterations finish on time with expected scope.
Steady Flow- Resources are maximized because of timely decisions that provide a steady flow of work.
Shared Understanding- The team understands the big picture and uses this understanding to deliver the
right features. They understand how small features fit in the big roadmap. They know where they are going,
and why.
Is your organization/team getting everything they expect out
of agile or are they searching for a missing link?

Myths Associated with Product Ownership
Myth- No Planning
Planning, especially product planning is essential. A Product Owner’s planning tools include the product
vision, product roadmap, release plan, and personas. Planning includes:
Understanding priorities
Reducing risk (business, technical, and social)
Increasing solutionvalueand feasibility
Aligning solutions to the organization’s strategy for serving users
POs do not plan using detailed solution specifications and/or project tasks. Instead, PO planning is more
about setting a direction, understandingvalue, and aligningvaluesand directions. POs expect plans to
change. As the product evolves and market conditions shift, POs apply new ideas, and only dig into
details for the most immediate pieces of work. Features and tasks are not well-defined until they rise to
the top of the priority list. Planning in the early stages of product development focus on what the product
is, what it does and what increments ofvalueshould be delivered.
Myth- No Documentation
The agile manifesto does not call for the end of documentation—it simply encourages collaboration over
documentation. Here are a few ways to demonstrate thisvalue:
Only document when it deliversvalueand when it makes sense. Don’t document out of fear, but
out ofvalue. Question whether or not documentation serves the team and the team’s goals.
If the team agrees a document will help them work faster, consider creating/maintaining the
document.
If documentation is “needed” because a process claims it is needed or someone fears it will be
needed, question thevalue.
Ask your team: “How long will the documentlive for and be valid?” “Who would pay for the
time it takes to create it, do theyvaluethe document that much?”
Myth - No Requirements or Business Analysis
We have all seen the list of roles for agile methodologies—they do not include a Business Analyst. Does
that mean we get to skip business analysis? Absolutely not! The skill set of business analysis is critical;
the role that performs this skill is flexible.
To fill this skill set on the team, manyBAs work with the POsto carry out the mission of product
ownership and keep the team moving forward. When BAs know where they fit and where to focus their
mindset, energy and skills, they are a huge asset to the team. Teams that neglect analysis struggle with
delivering timely andvaluableproducts.




The Three Pillars of Product Ownership
Now, more than ever, Product Owners need to develop a deeper understanding of their role, which leads
us to several obvious questions:
What are the characteristics of an effective Product Owner?
What are the responsibilities of an effective Product Owner?
What does the average day of a Product Owner look like?
What techniques do effective Product Owners use?
How do effective Product Owners model agile principles?
We will explore these questions below as we look at the pillars of product ownership, key aspects of the
role, and how to be a great Product Owner.
Product ownership balances on top of three pillars: value, decisionsand
engagement.
When all three pillars stand together, your team experiences
effective product ownership. A missing or stunted pillar
increases the likelihood your team will struggle. Effective
product ownership happens when the right person or group
consistently applies avaluemindset to facilitate good
decisionswith the team. Consider what happens when one of
the pillars is missing:
Without avaluemindset, your product might not align
with customer needs or organizational goals (getting
the right stuff built, not just building it faster).
Without the consistentengagementand presence of
the Product Owner, the team might lose focus or
productivity might suffer. The Product Owner needs to
beengagedwith the team to make timelydecisions.
Without a Product Owner that knows how to work collaboratively to make good,value-focused
decisions,your team might struggle with communication and the vision might become murky.
Without timelydecisionsthe team struggles with pace. Product owners need the authority to
make decisionsquickly. Waiting ondecisionsis detrimental to flow pace

he Agile Mindset for a Product Owner
At first glance, the 12 Agile Principles seem simple. But applying the lens of a Product Owner helps us
dig deeper. To truly understand the Product Ownermindset, let’s look at the 12Agile Principles from a
successful Product Owner’s point of view:
1.Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of
valuablesoftware.
PRODUCT OWNER LENS:What goes into each sprint/iteration is more important than the
iteration itself. POs determine the highest priority requirements, and that is what the team works on.
2.Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change
for the customer's competitive advantage.
PRODUCT OWNER LENS:Openness to emerging thoughts and ideas will make the product
morevaluableas we learn along the way. POs allow external market changes and feedback from
customers to continuously influence product vision and drivevalueto the customer. Effective POs
should be changing requirements and priorities as needed to maximizevalue.
3.Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
preference to the shorter timescale.
PRODUCT OWNER LENS:POs decide which functionality gets delivered and in what order.
POs and BAs help the team slice work into small increments ofvalue. POs and BAs help the team
slice stories using businessvalue, technical dependencies, technical debt, and learning from
experiments and research.
4.Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
PRODUCT 0WNER LENS:POs and BAs areengagedand available to the team on a daily
basis. They facilitate continuous conversations throughout the day using high impact form of
communication that results in rapid learning and fastdecision-making.When this is done well,
requirements and documentation are kept lightweight.
5.Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they
need, and trust them to get the job done.
PRODUCT OWNER LENS:Product owners serve the team, the user and the organization. They
determine what gets built and help the team understand each piece of work. The PO must have
authority to prioritize,make decisions, balance trade-offs, and say “no” when needed to features or
work that does not align with the product vision. The PO allows the development team to use their
technical know-how to co-design and develop feature



The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a
development team is face-to-face conversation.
PRODUCT OWNER LENS:The PO and BA donot “hand off” requirements and stories. They
areengagedand the team works together via conversations, facilitated sessions and structured dialog.
They collaborate on a daily basis to understand stories and features. The POvaluesface-to-face
conversation with the team over documentation. A common face-to-face collaboration format is the
“Three Amigos”, where the Developer, QA, and BA/PO get together to review stories.
7.Working software is the primary measure of progress.
PRODUCT OWNER LENS:Working software is defined byvalueto the users and organization.
The PO and BA demonstrate this principle via prioritized stories and well-defined acceptance criteria.
8.Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users
should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
PRODUCT OWNER LENS:The PO and BA deliver work, just in time, to developers. The PO
helps the team slice and estimate work. When the backlog is well refined, the planning and execution
of the iteration flows smoothly and maintains a steady, manageable pace.
9.Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
PRODUCT OWNER LENS:The PO and BA work with the development team to understand
technical risks, architecture, and debt. The PO contributes to technical excellence by helping the
development team understand the product vision and roadmap. In turn, the development team helps
the PO manage workflow and prioritization by communicating technical tasks in the context ofvalue.
10.Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.
PRODUCT OWNER LENS:The PO and BA refinethe backlog to shift the team’s focus to the
highest priority items. The PO has a ruthless focus onvalueand says “NO” to many items submitted
to the backlog. Teams do not spend time elaborating lower priority items. Details are sparse until
work items move to the top of the backlog.
11.The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
PRODUCT OWNER LENS:The PO sets the priorities, but all team members have the skills and
expertise needed to self-organize and get the work done.
12.At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and
adjusts its behavior accordingly.
PRODUCT OWNER LENS:POs and BAs participate in retrospectives. Frequent retrospectives
drive continuous improvement and change the way the team works to maximizevalueto the users
and organizations. POs are open to change in the product and the process
